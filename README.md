# Pong Game

Welcome to Pong Game, a classic arcade game implemented in Lua using the Love2D framework.

## Overview
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. Players control paddles on either side of the screen, deflecting a ball to prevent it from passing their paddle while attempting to score points by getting the ball past their opponent's paddle.
